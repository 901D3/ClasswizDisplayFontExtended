# CASIO Classwiz Modified font

Well it is not actually modified font, I put more codepoint for some missing codepoint

The original is from [Wenti-D](https://github.com/Wenti-D/ClasswizDisplayFont)

You can use this ClassWiz calculator font as UI font or other purposes

idk why i forked repo with the MathIO font included

The font will be update regularly, older mod still intact
